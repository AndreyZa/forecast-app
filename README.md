# Forecast app 🌧

It is test task from outsourcing company when they wanted hire me for position **Front-end developer**.Task is following instructions:

> Forecast app. Do not use create-react-app, use Webpack to build application and modules.The user enters a city into input field and has a detailed, visualised forecast for today.Clicking on the link below this forecast, user is going to another page, which containsforecast for a couple days ahead (3, 5, week), no matter. From there user can go back. (useReact Router).Under the input field is needed to see last 5 cities you’ve looked for and clicking on them wesee forecast for today again.Request to API is going just once for one city in time till the page is reloaded, so it’s neededto use Redux state, please don’t use Local Storage.Design is important for us, but we don’t have strong rules, use your imagination, CSS keyframes, transform and transitions are welcome. You can use reactstrap libraries.You can use this (https://openweathermap.org/api) or another API you like.
