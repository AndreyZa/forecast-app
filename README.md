# Forecast app ðŸŒ§

It is test task which I get from outsourcing company when they want hire me for position **Front-end developer**.Task is following instructions:

> Forecast app. Do not use create-react-app, use Webpack to build application and modules.The user enters a city into input field and has a detailed, visualised forecast for today.Clicking on the link below this forecast, user is going to another page, which containsforecast for a couple days ahead (3, 5, week), no matter. From there user can go back. (useReact Router).Under the input field is needed to see last 5 cities youâ€™ve looked for and clicking on them wesee forecast for today again.Request to API is going just once for one city in time till the page is reloaded, so itâ€™s neededto use Redux state, please donâ€™t use Local Storage.Design is important for us, but we donâ€™t have strong rules, use your imagination, CSS keyframes, transform and transitions are welcome. You can use reactstrap libraries.You can use this (https://openweathermap.org/api) or another API you like.
